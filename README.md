## Your Memes deserve Respect
Have you ever wondered how an image should really look, without all that UI chrome, branding, zoom distortion, and usable features?

Look no further!

GMeme is designed to be a simple place to view all of your most important memes, straight from your desktop without any need for pesky controls.

All of your memes deserve respect. They are humanity's art! To this end, GMeme displays all images at a 1:1 ratio. No more compromising because of auto scaling!

Finally, GMeme is fast, cross-platform, and light. It uses Qt5's label/pixmap system to display your images with quality no matter where you are.

So if you're using Haiku, Windows XP, Mac OS X Kitten, or FreeNAS for your desktop, you can rely on GMeme to show your pictures!
